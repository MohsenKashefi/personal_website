# Dynamic Projects Setup - Complete! 🎉

Your Flutter website now loads projects dynamically from Supabase! When you add/edit projects in the dashboard, they automatically appear on your website with the same beautiful card design.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Added Supabase Package
- Added `supabase_flutter: ^2.5.0` to `pubspec.yaml`
- Run `flutter pub get` to install

### 2. Created Supabase Configuration
- Created `lib/config/supabase_config.dart`
- Initializes connection to your Supabase database

### 3. Created ProjectService
- Created `lib/services/project_service.dart`
- Fetches projects from Supabase
- Has automatic fallback to hardcoded projects if API fails

### 4. Updated Project Model
- Added `fromJson()` method to parse Supabase data
- Added `toJson()` method for future use
- Keeps all existing project data as fallback

### 5. Updated ProjectsSection
- Loads projects dynamically on page load
- Shows loading indicator while fetching
- Falls back to hardcoded projects if API fails
- Keeps the same beautiful card design!

### 6. Updated main.dart
- Initializes Supabase on app startup

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Get Your Supabase Credentials

1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com
2. Select your project
3. Go to: **Settings** → **API**
4. Copy these two values:
   - **Project URL** (looks like: `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`)
   - **anon public** key (long string starting with `eyJ...`)

### Step 2: Add Credentials to Config

Open: `lib/config/supabase_config.dart`

Replace these lines:
```dart
static const String supabaseUrl = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL';
static const String supabaseAnonKey = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY';
```

With your actual values:
```dart
static const String supabaseUrl = 'https://xxxxx.supabase.co';
static const String supabaseAnonKey = 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...';
```

### Step 3: Test It!

Run your Flutter app:
```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

You should see:
- Loading indicator briefly
- Projects loaded from Supabase
- Same beautiful card design as before!

## 🎯 How It Works

### Adding Projects from Dashboard:

1. **Go to your dashboard:** https://portfolio-dashboard-three-orpin.vercel.app
2. **Login** with your admin credentials
3. **Go to "Projects" section**
4. **Click "Add Project"**
5. Fill in the details:
   - Title
   - Description
   - Category (Mobile/Package/etc.)
   - Technologies (comma-separated)
   - GitHub URL
   - Live URL (video demo)
   - Image path (e.g., `assets/myproject.png`)
   - Icon name (e.g., `lock`, `flutter`, `code`)
   - Is Featured (checkbox)
6. **Save**

### On Your Website:

1. **Refresh your Flutter website**
2. **The new project appears automatically!**
3. Same 3D flip card design
4. Same filtering by category
5. Same hover effects and animations

## 📊 Project Fields Mapping

| Dashboard Field | Flutter Display |
|----------------|-----------------|
| `title` | Card title |
| `description` | Back of card description |
| `category` | Filter category badge |
| `technologies` | Tech stack chips |
| `github_url` | GitHub icon link |
| `live_url` | Video demo icon link |
| `image_path` | Front of card image (e.g., `assets/foody.png`) |
| `icon_name` | Icon if no image (e.g., `lock`, `flutter`) |
| `is_featured` | Featured badge on card |
| `order_index` | Display order |

## 🖼️ Adding Project Images

### Option 1: Use an Icon
Set `icon_name` to one of these:
- `lock` - Lock icon
- `security` - Security shield
- `shield` - Shield
- `key` - Key icon
- `password` - Password icon
- `check` - Check circle
- `package` - Package/box icon
- `flutter` - Flutter dash
- `code` - Code brackets (default)

### Option 2: Use an Image
1. Add your image to Flutter project: `assets/myproject.png`
2. Add to `pubspec.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   assets:
     - assets/myproject.png
   ```
3. Set `image_path` in dashboard: `assets/myproject.png`
4. Rebuild your Flutter app

## ✅ Benefits

### Before (Hardcoded):
- ❌ Had to edit Dart code to add projects
- ❌ Had to rebuild and redeploy Flutter app
- ❌ Required developer knowledge
- ❌ Time consuming

### After (Dynamic):
- ✅ Add projects from dashboard web UI
- ✅ Changes appear instantly on website
- ✅ Non-developers can manage projects
- ✅ Update anytime, anywhere
- ✅ Keeps same beautiful design
- ✅ Automatic fallback to hardcoded projects

---

## 🔄 Fallback System

Your website is **fault-tolerant**:

1. **If Supabase works:** Shows projects from database ✅
2. **If Supabase fails:** Shows hardcoded projects ✅
3. **If no internet:** Shows hardcoded projects ✅

You always have a working website!

- [ ] Flutter app compiles without errors
- [ ] Website shows loading indicator
- [ ] Projects load from Supabase
- [ ] Filter buttons work (All/Mobile/Package)
- [ ] Cards flip on hover
- [ ] GitHub/Video links work
- [ ] Add a test project from dashboard
- [ ] New project appears on website

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Projects not loading?

**Check Console:**
```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

Look for:
- `✅ Fetched X projects from Supabase` - Success!
- `⚠️ Supabase not initialized` - Check credentials
- `⚠️ Error fetching projects` - Check Supabase is running

**Common Issues:**

1. **Wrong credentials:**
   - Double-check URL and anon key in `supabase_config.dart`
   - Make sure no extra spaces

2. **Supabase not accessible:**
   - Check RLS policies allow public read
   - Verify projects table exists

3. **Still using old projects:**
   - Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Chrome)
   - Clear browser cache

### SQL to verify Supabase setup:

Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Check if projects table exists
SELECT * FROM projects ORDER BY order_index;

-- Check RLS policy for public read
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'projects';
```

You should see the "Allow public read for projects" policy.

## 🎨 Customization

### Want to add more fields?

1. **Add column to Supabase:**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN new_field TEXT;
   ```

2. **Update Project model:**
   ```dart
   final String? newField;
   // Add to fromJson and toJson
   ```

3. **Update dashboard form** to include new field

4. **Update Flutter UI** to display it
